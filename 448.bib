abstract = {The comparative distribution of peptidergic neural systems in the brain of the euryhaline, viviparous teleost Poecilia latipinna (green molly) was examined by immunohistochemistry. Topographically distinct, but often overlapping, systems of neurons and fibres displaying immunoreactivity (ir) related to a range of neuropeptides were found in most brain areas. Neurosecretory and hypophysiotrophic hormones were localized to specific groups of neurons mostly within the preoptic and tuberal hypothalamus, giving fibre projections to the neurohypophysis, ventral telencephalon, thalamus, and brain stem. Separate vasotocin (AVT)-ir and isotocin (IST)-ir cells were located in the nucleus preopticus (nPO), but many AVT-ir nPO neurons also displayed growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF)-like-ir, and in some animals corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF)-like-ir. The main group of CRF-ir neurons was located in the nucleus recessus anterioris, where coexistence with galanin (GAL) was observed in some cells. Enkephalin (ENK)-like-ir was occasionally present in a few IST-ir cells of the nPO and was also found in small neurons in the posterior tuberal hypothalamus and in a cluster of large cells in the dorsal midbrain tegmentum. Thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH)-ir cells were found near the rostromedial tip of the nucleus recessus lateralis. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-ir cells were present in the nucleus olfactoretinalis, ventral telencephalon, preoptic area, and dorsal midbrain tegmentum. Molluscan cardioexcitatory peptide (FMRF-amide)-ir was colocalized with GnRH-ir in the ganglion cells and central projections of the nervus terminalis. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-ir neurons were restricted to the tuberal hypothalamus, mostly within the nucleus lateralis tuberis pars lateralis, and somatostatin (SRIF)-ir neurons were numerous throughout the periventricular areas of the diencephalon. A further group of SRIF-ir neurons extending from the ventral telencephalon into the dorsal telencephalon pars centralis also contained neuropeptide Y (NPY)-, peptide YY (PYY)-, and NPY flanking peptide (PSW)-like-ir. These immunoreactivities were, however, also observed in non-SRIF-ir cells and fibres, particularly in the mesencephalon. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-like-ir had a characteristic distribution in cells grouped in the isthmal region and fibre tracts running forward into the hypothalamus, most strikingly into the inferior lobes. Antisera to cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurokinin A (NK) or substance P (SP) stained very extensive, separate systems throughout the brain, with cells most consistently seen in the ventral telencephalon and periventricular hypothalamus. Broadly similar, but much more restricted, distributions of cells and fibres were seen with antisera to neurotensin (NT) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {We propose a computational approach to modeling the collective dynamics of populations of coupled, heterogeneous biological oscillators. We consider the synchronization of yeast glycolytic oscillators coupled by the membrane exchange of an intracellular metabolite; the heterogeneity consists of a single random parameter, which accounts for glucose influx into each cell. In contrast to Monte Carlo simulations, distributions of intracellular species of these yeast cells are represented by a few leading order generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) coefficients, thus reducing the dynamics of an ensemble of oscillators to dynamics of their (typically significantly fewer) representative gPC coefficients. Equation-free (EF) methods are employed to efficiently evolve this coarse description in time and compute the coarse-grained stationary state and/or limit cycle solutions, circumventing the derivation of explicit, closed-form evolution equations. Coarse projective integration and fixed-point algorithms are used to compute collective oscillatory solutions for the cell population and quantify their stability. These techniques are extended to the special case of a "rogue" oscillator; a cell sufficiently different from the rest "escapes" the bulk synchronized behavior and oscillates with a markedly different amplitude. The approach holds promise for accelerating the computer-assisted analysis of detailed models of coupled heterogeneous cell or agent populations.},

Phase density equations are then used to analyze the role of the bifurcation, and the resulting PRC, in responses to stimuli. In particular, we explore the interplay among stimulus duration, baseline firing frequency, and population-level response patterns.

The brain's structural and functional systems have features of complex networks--such as small-world topology, highly connected hubs and modularity--both at the whole-brain scale of human neuroimaging and at a cellular scale in non-human animals. In this article, we review studies investigating complex brain networks in diverse experimental modalities (including structural and functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography in humans) and provide an accessible introduction to the basic principles of graph theory. We also highlight some of the technical challenges and key questions to be addressed by future developments in this rapidly moving field.},

abstract = {Given the dramatic behavioral effects of winning and losing contests, and pronounced changes in stress and sex steroid hormones post-fight, it is reasonable to suppose that these hormones also dictate future behavior. We sampled water-borne cortisol, testosterone (T), and 11-ketotestosterone (KT) before and after contests in the mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, to determine how endogenous steroid hormone levels might predict and respond to contest dynamics or success. Pre-fight cortisol related negatively, and pre-fight T related positively to contest initiation and winning, particularly in the smaller opponent. In the pairs where a larger fish won the contest, winners with higher pre-fight T and lower pre-fight cortisol delivered more attacks to the losers. Contest duration and escalation influenced post-fight hormone concentrations primarily in losers. Escalation significantly increased post-fight cortisol, T, and KT for losers but not for winners. However, winners that attacked losers at higher rates had higher levels of post-fight cortisol. Losers also demonstrate the most consistent post-fight hormone responses, particularly to contest escalation and duration. Despite the bidirectional relationship between hormones and contest behavior, we found no overall mean differences in pre- or post-fight cortisol, T, or KT between eventual winners and losers. Thus, it is evident that the categorical states of winner and loser cannot alone reveal the complex, reciprocal associations between endocrine systems and social behavior.},

abstract = {A functional polymorphism within the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has been reported to modulate emotionality and risk for affective disorders. The short (S) allele has less functional efficacy than the long (L) allele and has been associated with enhanced emotional reactivity. One possible contributing factor to the high emotionality in S carriers may be inefficient use of cognitive strategies such as reappraisal to regulate emotional responses. The aim of the present study was to test whether the 5-HTTLPR genotype modulates the neural correlates of emotion regulation. To determine neural differences between S and L allele carriers during reappraisal of negative emotions, 15 homozygous S (S'/S') and 15 homozygous L (L'/L') carriers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while performing an instructed emotion regulation task including downregulation, upregulation and passive viewing of negative emotional pictures. Compared to L'/L' allele carriers, subjects who carry the S'/S' allele responded with lower posterior insula and prefrontal brain activation during passive perception of negative emotional information but showed greater prefrontal activation and anterior insula activation during down- and upregulation of negative emotional responses. The current results support and extend previous findings of enhanced emotionality in S carriers by providing additional evidence of 5-HTTLPR modulation of volitional emotion regulation.},

abstract = {Recent neurophysiological evidence in the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) demonstrated that isotocin (IT) and arginine vasotocin (AVT) modulate fictive vocalizations divergently between three reproductive morphs. To provide an anatomical framework for the modulation of vocalization by IT and to foster comparisons with the distributions of the IT homologues mesotocin (MT) and oxytocin (OT) in other vertebrate groups, we describe putative IT distributions in the midshipman and the closely related gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta. Double-label fluorescent histochemistry was used for IT and AVT (by using antibodies for MT, OT, and the mammalian AVT homologue, arginine vasopressin [AVP]). MT/OT-like immunoreactive (MT/OT-lir) cell groups were found in the anterior parvocellular, posterior parvocellular, and magnocellular preoptic nuclei. MT/OT-lir fibers and putative terminals densely innervated the ventral telencephalon and numerous areas in the hypothalamus and brainstem. These distributions included all sites of vocal-acoustic integration recently identified for the forebrain and midbrain and diencephalic components of the ascending auditory pathway. Results were qualitatively comparable across morphs, species, and seasons. In contrast to the widespread distribution of MT/OT-lir, AVP-lir somata, fibers, and putative terminals were almost completely restricted to vocal-acoustic regions. These data parallel previous descriptions of AVT immunoreactivity in these species, although the present methods showed a previously undescribed, seasonally variable AVP-lir cell group in the anterior tuberal hypothalamus, a vocally active site and a component of the ascending auditory pathway. These findings provided anatomic support for the role of IT and AVT in the modulation of vocal behavior at multiple levels of the central vocal-acoustic circuitry.},

@article{Goodson2009,
abstract = {Vertebrate animals exhibit a spectacular diversity of social behaviors, yet a variety of basic social behavior processes are essential to all species. These include social signaling; discrimination of conspecifics and sexual partners; appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors; aggression and dominance behaviors; and parental behaviors (the latter with rare exceptions). These behaviors are of fundamental importance and are regulated by an evolutionarily conserved, core social behavior network (SBN) of the limbic forebrain and midbrain. The SBN encodes social information in a highly dynamic, distributed manner, such that behavior is most strongly linked to the pattern of neural activity across the SBN, not the activity of single loci. Thus, shifts in the relative weighting of activity across SBN nodes can conceivably produce almost limitless variation in behavior, including diversity across species (as weighting is modified through evolution), across behavioral contexts (as weights change temporally) and across behavioral phenotypes (as weighting is specified through heritable and developmental processes). Individual neural loci may also express diverse relationships to behavior, depending upon temporal variations in their functional connectivity to other brain regions ("neural context"). We here review the basic properties of the SBN and show how behavioral variation relates to functional connectivity of the network, and discuss ways in which neuroendocrine factors adjust network activity to produce behavioral diversity. In addition to the actions of steroid hormones on SBN state, we examine the temporally plastic and evolutionarily labile properties of the nonapeptides (the vasopressin- and oxytocin-like neuropeptides), and show how variations in nonapeptide signaling within the SBN serve to promote behavioral diversity across social contexts, seasons, phenotypes and species. Although this diversity is daunting in its complexity, the search for common "organizing principles" has become increasingly fruitful. We focus on multiple aspects of behavior, including sexual behavior, aggression and affiliation, and in each of these areas, we show how broadly relevant insights have been obtained through the examination of behavioral diversity in a wide range of vertebrate taxa.},

abstract = {Noxious stimuli have motivational power and can support associative learning, but the neural circuitry mediating such avoidance learning is poorly understood. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is implicated in the affective response to noxious stimuli and the motivational properties of conditioned stimuli that predict noxious stimulation. Using conditioned place aversion (CPA) in rats, we found that excitatory amino acid microinjection into the ACC during conditioning produces avoidance learning in the absence of a peripheral noxious stimulus. Furthermore, microinjection of an excitatory amino acid antagonist into the ACC during conditioning blocked learning elicited by a noxious stimulus. ACC lesions made after conditioning did not impair expression of CPA. Thus, ACC neuronal activity is necessary and sufficient for noxious stimuli to produce an aversive teaching signal. Our results support the idea that a shared ACC pathway mediates both pain-induced negative affect and a nociceptor-driven aversive teaching signal.},

Theory and evidence suggest that instructive UCS inputs to the amygdala will be inhibited when the UCS is expected, but this has not been found during fear conditioning. We investigated neural pathways that relay information about the UCS to the amygdala by recording neurons in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (PAG) of rats during fear conditioning. UCS-evoked responses in both amygdala and PAG were inhibited by expectation. Pharmacological inactivation of the PAG attenuated UCS-evoked responses in the amygdala and impaired acquisition of fear conditioning, indicating that PAG may be an important part of the pathway that relays instructive signals to the amygdala.},

This technique is based on successive anisotropic diffusion simulations over the human brain, which are utilized to construct three dimensional diffusion fronts. The fiber pathways are determined by evaluating the distance and orientation from the fronts to their corresponding diffusion seeds. Synthetic and real DT-MRI data are employed to demonstrate the tracking scheme. It is shown that the synthetic tracts are accurately replicated, and several major white matter fiber pathways can be reproduced noninvasively, with the tract branching being allowed. Since simulating the diffusion process, which is truly a physical phenomenon reflecting the underlying architecture of cerebral tissues, makes full use of the diffusion tensor data, including both the magnitude and orientation information, the proposed approach is expected to enhance robustness and reliability in white matter fiber reconstruction.},

abstract = {We study a stochastic nonlocal partial differential equation, arising in the context of modelling spatially distributed neural activity, which is capable of sustaining stationary and moving spatially localized 'activity bumps'. This system is known to undergo a pitchfork bifurcation in bump speed as a parameter (the strength of adaptation) is changed; yet increasing the noise intensity effectively slowed the motion of the bump. Here we study the system from the point of view of describing the high-dimensional stochastic dynamics in terms of the effective dynamics of a single scalar 'coarse' variable, i.e. reducing the dimensionality of the system. We show that such a reduced description in the form of an effective Langevin equation characterized by a double-well potential is quantitatively successful. The effective potential can be extracted using short, appropriately initialized bursts of direct simulation, and the effects of changing parameters on this potential can easily be studied. We demonstrate this approach in terms of (a) an experience-based 'intelligent' choice of the coarse variable and (b) a variable obtained through data-mining direct simulation results, using a diffusion map approach.},

The existence of a spectral gap for the coupling network graph Laplacian suggests that the graph dynamics may quickly become low dimensional. Our first choice of coarse variables consists of the components of the oscillator states—their (complex) phase angles—along the leading eigenvectors of this Laplacian. We then use the equation-free framework, circumventing the derivation of explicit coarse-grained equations, to perform computational tasks such as coarse projective integration, coarse fixed-point, and coarse limit-cycle computations. In a second step, we explore an approach to incorporating oscillator heterogeneity in the coarse-graining process. The approach is based on the observation of fast-developing correlations between oscillator state and oscillator intrinsic properties and establishes a connection with tools developed in the context of uncertainty quantification.},

abstract = {Teleost fish have oxygen-sensitive neuroepithelial cells (NECs) in the gills that appear to mediate physiological responses to hypoxia, but little is known about oxygen sensing in amphibious fish. The mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus, is an amphibious fish that respires via the gills and/or the skin. First, we hypothesized that both the skin and gills are sites of oxygen sensing in K. marmoratus. Serotonin-positive NECs were abundant in both gills and skin, as determined by immunohistochemical labelling and fluorescence microscopy. NECs retained synaptic vesicles and were found near nerve fibres labelled with the neuronal marker zn-12. Skin NECs were 42\% larger than those of the gill, as estimated by measurement of projection area, and 45\% greater in number. Moreover, for both skin and gill NECs, NEC area increased significantly (30-60\%) following 7 days of exposure to hypoxia (1.5 mg l(-1) dissolved oxygen). Another population of cells containing vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) proteins were also observed in the skin and gills. The second hypothesis we tested was that K. marmoratus emerse in order to breathe air cutaneously when challenged with severe aquatic hypoxia, and this response will be modulated by neurochemicals associated chemoreceptor activity. Acute exposure to hypoxia induced fish to emerse at 0.2 mg l(-1). When K. marmoratus were pre-exposed to serotonin or acetylcholine, they emersed at a significantly higher concentration of oxygen than untreated fish. Pre-exposure to receptor antagonists (ketanserin and hexamethonium) predictably resulted in fish emersing at a lower concentration of oxygen. Taken together, these results suggest that oxygen sensing occurs at the branchial and/or cutaneous surfaces in K. marmoratus and that serotonin and acetylcholine mediate, in part, the emersion response.},

Therefore, this network consisting of the amygdala, the anterior insula, the superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) may rather be involved in more general relevance detection which should be independent of the sensory modality of the stimuli. In the current study, we used functional MRI to measure brain activations while participants either viewed pictures that varied in their emotional and social content or listened to sounds that varied along the same dimensions. The amygdala, the anterior insula, the STS, and the OFC showed increased activation during processing of emotional as well as social stimuli independent of the sensory modality in which the stimuli were presented. Moreover, social emotional stimuli elicited more pronounced activity in this network than stimuli with solely emotional or social content. These results indicate that the proposed network involved in relevance detection works independently of the source of relevance (emotional or social information mediated by the stimulus) and modality.},

These findings provide evidence for encoding differences on the basis of subsequent evaluations, suggesting that the amygdala and PCC are important for forming first impressions.},

In this study the density of neurons and synapses was measured in three different areas (8, 6, and 17) of the neocortex of the mouse. Both kinds of measurements were made on the same material, embedded in Epon/Araldit. In order to determine the synaptic density per mm3, the proportion of synaptic neuropil was also measured; it was found to be 84\%. The cortical volume occupied by cell bodies of neurons and glia cells amounted to 12\%, that by blood vessels to 4\%. The total average was 9.2 x 10(4) neurons/mm3 and 7.2 x 10(8) synapses/mm3. About 11\% of the synapses were of type II. The density of neurons increased with decreasing cortical thickness; thus the number of neurons under a given surface area was about constant. The synaptic density, on the other hand, was almost constant in the three areas, the number of synapses under a given cortical surface area tended, therefore, to increase with cortical thickness. The average number of synapses per neuron was 8,200, with a tendency to increase with increasing cortical thickness. Shrinkage of the tissue was also measured for various staining techniques. No shrinkage occurred during perfusion with 3.7\% formaldehyde or with a solution of buffered paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde and during fixation in situ. Electron microscopical material showed almost no shrinkage, whereas Nissl-preparations on paraffin-embedded material had only 43\% of their original volume. After Nissl stain on frozen sections the volume had shrunken to 68\% and after Golgi impregnation and embedding in celloidin to 70\%. The total volume of the neocortex was 112 mm3 (both hemispheres together). The total number of neurons was thus 1.0 x 10(7) and the total number of synapses 8.1 x 10(10).},

We report that the selective group III metabotropic receptor agonist L(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) depresses GABAergic transmission to interneurons more than to pyramidal neurons. The L-AP4-induced depression is accompanied by changes in trial-to-trial variability and paired-pulse depression that imply a presynaptic site of action. Brief trains of stimuli in Schaffer collaterals also depress GABAergic transmission to interneurons. This depression persists when GABA(B) receptors are blocked, is enhanced by blocking glutamate uptake, and is abolished by the group III metabotropic receptor antagonist (alpha-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP). The results imply that GABAergic transmission among interneurons is modulated by glutamate spillover from excitatory afferent terminals.},

However, the largest of these models run inconveniently slowly and require vast amounts of electrical power, which hinders useful experimentation. SpiNNaker is a novel computer architecture designed to address these problems using low-power microprocessors and custom communication hardware. We use four SpiNNaker chips (of a planned fifty thousand) to simulate, in real-time, a cortical circuit of ten thousand spiking neurons and four million synapses. In this simulation, the hardware consumes 100nJ per neuron per millisecond and 43nJ per postsynaptic potential, which is the smallest quantity reported for any digital computer. We argue that this approaches fast, power-feasible and scientifically useful simulations of large cortical areas.},

abstract = {A systematic assessment of global neural network connectivity through direct electrophysiological assays has remained technically unfeasible even in dissociated neuronal cultures. We introduce an improved algorithmic approach based on Transfer Entropy to reconstruct approximations to network structural connectivities from network activity monitored through calcium fluorescence imaging. Based on information theory, our method requires no prior assumptions on the statistics of neuronal firing and neuronal connections. The performance of our algorithm is benchmarked on surrogate time-series of calcium fluorescence generated by the simulated dynamics of a network with known ground-truth topology. We find that the effective network topology revealed by Transfer Entropy depends qualitatively on the time-dependent dynamic state of the network (e.g., bursting or non-bursting). We thus demonstrate how conditioning with respect to the global mean activity improves the performance of our method. [...] Compared to other reconstruction strategies such as cross-correlation or Granger Causality methods, our method based on improved Transfer Entropy is remarkably more accurate. In particular, it provides a good reconstruction of the network clustering coefficient, allowing to discriminate between weakly or strongly clustered topologies, whereas on the other hand an approach based on cross-correlations would invariantly detect artificially high levels of clustering. Finally, we present the applicability of our method to real recordings of in vitro cortical cultures. We demonstrate that these networks are characterized by an elevated level of clustering compared to a random graph (although not extreme) and by a markedly non-local connectivity.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

abstract = {Thermotaxis is a model to elucidate how nervous systems sense and memorize environmental conditions to regulate behavioral strategies in Caenorhabditis elegans. The genetic and neural imaging analyses revealed molecular and cellular bases of this experience-dependent behavior. Surprisingly, thermosensory neurons themselves memorize the sensed temperatures. Recently developed techniques for optical manipulation of neuronal activity have facilitated the revelation that there is a sophisticated information flow between sensory neurons and interneurons. Further studies on thermotaxis will allow us to understand the fundamental logics of neural processing from sensory perceptions to behavioral outputs.},

abstract ={The propagation of activity is studied in a spatially structured network model of γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) neurons exhibiting postinhibitory rebound. In contrast to excitatory-coupled networks, recruitment spreads very slowly because cells fire only after the postsynaptic conductance decays, and with two possible propagation modes. If the connection strength decreases monotonically with distance (on-center), then propagation occurs in a discontinuous manner. If the self- and nearby connections are absent (off-center), propagation can proceed smoothly. Modest changes in the synaptic reversal potential can result in depolarization-mediated waves that are 25 times faster. Functional and developmental roles for these behaviors and implications for thalamic circuitry are suggested.},

Abstract = {{Propagation of discharges in cortical and thalamic systems, which is
   used as a probe for examining network circuitry, is studied by
   constructing a one-dimensional model of integrate-and-fire neurons that
   are coupled by excitatory synapses with delay. Each neuron fires only
   one spike. The velocity and stability of propagating continuous pulses
   are calculated analytically. Above a certain critical value of the
   constant delay, these pulses lose stability. Instead, lurching pulses
   propagate with discontinuous and periodic spatio-temporal
   characteristics. The parameter regime for which lurching occurs is
   strongly affected by the footprint (connectivity) shape; bistability may
   occur with a square footprint shape but not with an exponential
   footprint shape. For strong synaptic coupling, the velocity of both
   continuous and lurching pulses increases logarithmically with the
   synaptic coupling strength g(syn) for an exponential footprint shape,
   and it is bounded for a step footprint shape, We conclude that the
   differences in velocity and shape between the front of thalamic spindle
   waves in vitro and cortical paroxysmal discharges stem from their
   different effective delay; in thalamic networks, large effective delay
   between inhibitory neurons arises from their effective interaction via
   the excitatory cells which display postinhibitory rebound.}},
